# KritaThemePink
This is Krita pink theme and other hot pink themes.


I made 4 different templates for the pink theme in Krita.
The first one is the darkest the second one is softer with light tones,
the third would be salmon and the room is very hot pink and has a little orange detail.

1 - Dark Pink
2 - Soft Pink
3 - Salmon

4 - Grunge Pink

The tutorial is quite simple:
Restart Krita to see the changes, and choose your theme. 
If this was fun, and you want to create new colors, soon I'll be recording a video explaining how I did it and how you can do it too.
